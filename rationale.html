            <h2>Rationale</h2>
                    
                <p>There are several features and improvements we made to the current COMP 1950 website. Here, we discuss these proposed changes, and why they are beneficial. We also discuss proposals that we did not implement, but could in the future. These are listed below.</p>
                    
                <br>
                <br>
            
            <h3>Features and Benefits Implemented</h3>
                    
                <br>
                <br>  
              <!-----------------------------<h3>Home Page</h3>----------PLANNING FOR NOW -- WILL EDIT THIS LATER---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The COMP 1950 Home Page contains a description of the course, a calendar, and a news section.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>This simple, yet informative home page gives users the important information they need the moment they enter the site. </p>
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>A calendar has been added on to the Home Page.</p></span>

                    <p>The calendar feature allows users to see what events are coming up, such as lecture dates and times, final exams, and major projects. The calendar can be used as a monthly calendar or a daily calendar. Students and instructors can also navigate between months and days, and they can also easily go back to the current date by clicking on the “reset” button. This helps make it easier see and plan for major upcoming events.</p>

                <span class="key_point"><p>A News Section has been added on to the Home Page</p></span>
                    
                    <p>The news section on the home page gives students easy access to important, relevant news.For instance, if the instructor is ill and class needs to be cancelled, the instructor can post it. When students go onto the website, they will easily be able to see this announcement and know that class has been cancelled. </p>
                
                
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>Footer contains sitemap, instructor email, and links to the top of the page and the home page.</p></span>

                    <p>By putting the sitemap in the footer, students and instructors will always have easy access to all the links on the site. Since this can be expanded or contracted, users can shrink this feature if it is not needed, which saves valuable space.</p>

                    <p>By putting the instructor email in the footer, students will be able to easily email the instructor without having to switch to another page. This also contains the instructor’s name so students know who to address the email to.</p>

                    <p>The link to the top of the page makes it easy to move back to the top once users have reached the bottom of the page. This can save users a lot of time, especially if it is a long lecture page.</p>

                    <p>The link to the home page allows users to easily access the homepage from anywhere on the website. This is especially handy if they need to access the calendar or the news section.</p>

                    
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The header contains the navigation bar, a search bar, and a login button. </p></span>

                    <p>This simple header contains the key components users will need access to. By placing it horizontally at the top of every page, it takes up less space, yet is easily accessible. </p>

                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The Navigation Bar is has been divided into four main categories: home page, lectures, quizzes, and additional information/ resources about the course.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>This was designed to represent the four key sections of the website. When you hover over these, it will expand and you can choose which lecture you want from there. The great thing about this feature is that you can see all your options without leaving the current page you are on. Since this was trategically divided into these categories, all the pages on the site will have a clear home.</p>

                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>A Log-In feature was implemented to let users login to their personal accounts.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>From there, they can check their grades or submit assignments. When you are logged in, if you hover over your log in icon, you can easily access the links to submit assignments or check grades.This will also prevent unauthorized people from access these tools. One feature that we would add is the ability to complete quizzes online.</p>

                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The search bar on the top right hand side of the page lets users search the course site. </p></span>
                    
                    <p>For instance, if a student wants to learn more about sprites, but they do not remember which lecture it was in, they could use the search feature and it will find the relevant page(s) they are looking for. With the word “search…” in the background and the little magnifying glasses to search, users will already be familiar with this tool.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>All lectures are contained in the Lectures section of the Navigation bar. To access, hover over lectures and click on the lecture you want to see.</p></span>

                    <p>This clean, simple format allows users to access the different lectures as needed, and it automatically hides itself when it is not needed. Since this is not static, it saves a lot of valuable space when not in use.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>All quizzes are contained in the Lectures section of the Navigation bar. To access, hover over quizzes and click on the quiz you want to access.</p></span>

                    <p>This layout of the quizzes allows users to access the different quizzes as needed, and it automatically hides itself when it is not needed. On the current COMP 1950 website, this is not an option.  As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to access quizzes. This would make access to quizzes faster and simpler. At the bottom of quiz, there is a submit and a reset button. The submit button makes it easy to hand in quizzes, while the reset button erases all answers. This is not implemented, but one feature would be to ask the student if they are sure they want to reset as a warning, just in case they clicked the button by mistake. </p>
                
                    <p>This could also replace the current written quizzes, since it can also accept multiple choice, true or false, or short answer questions and answers. This could also save the department resources since they would reduce the amount of paper and ink they use to print these quizzes. Another benefit of doing these quizzes online is that they can also make it easier for the instructor since they would not be forced to read student’s messy handwriting.</p>

                    <p>One feature that could be implemented in the future is the ability to automatically mark quizzes once they have been submitted. This would give students automatic feedback, and save the instructor time for marking and handing back written quizzes. </p>

                    <p>Another feature would be a timer, which automatically starts when students open the quiz. For instance, if the instructor only wants students to have 10 minutes for the quiz, they can set the time. When students click to start the quiz, the timer automatically beings. When the time runs out and the student has not already submitted the quiz, the quiz will stop working and the only option the student will have will be to submit the quiz. This reduces academic dishonestly by preventing students from sneaking in extra time for their quiz. </p>

                    <p>This feature can also be expanded to include set quiz deadlines, where the quiz automatically becomes available and disabled at certain times. For instance, if the instructor does not want students to have access to a quiz until class time at 6:00pm, they can set it so that it automatically becomes accessible at that time. On the other hand, if the instructor wants all quizzes to be handed in by 11:59pm on a Tuesday evening, this can be set so that any quiz is no longer accessible after 11:59pm on a Tuesday evening, and any quiz in progress will have to be submitted or closed.</p>

            <span class="key_point"><p>When user is on the phone, remove the lecture timeline</p></span> 
                   
            <span class="key_point"><p>Didnt add in: link to add to hw page to submit hw and access it from lecture -- so still on lecture page</p></span>
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>Calendar - This feature can also be used by students and instructors to add their own private events, such as group meetings or personal study schedules (not implemented yet).  -- calendar</p></span>
