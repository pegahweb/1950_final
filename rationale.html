            <h2>Rationale</h2>
                    
                <p>There are several features and improvements we made to the current COMP 1950 website. Here, we discuss these proposed changes, and why they are beneficial. We also discuss proposals that we did not implement, but could in the future.</p>
                    
                <br>
                <br>
            
            <h3>Features and Benefits Implemented</h3>
                    
                <br>
                <br>  
              <!-----------------------------<h3>Home Page</h3>----------PLANNING FOR NOW -- WILL EDIT THIS LATER---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The COMP 1950 Home Page contains a description of the course, a calendar, and a news section.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>By having only these key items on the home page, users will not feel overwhelmed by irrelevant information. This simple, yet informative home page gives users the important information they need the moment they enter the site. The description tell students what the course is about, what its purpose is, and what they will achieve at the end of the course.</p>
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>A calendar has been added on to the Home Page.</p></span>

                    <p>The calendar feature allows users to see what events are coming up, such as lecture dates and times, final exams, and major projects. This will also state the lecture rooms and times. The calendar can be used as a monthly calendar or a daily calendar. Students and instructors can also navigate between months and days, and they can also easily go back to the current date by clicking on the “reset” button. This helps make it easier see and plan for major upcoming events.</p>
                    
                    <p>One feature we would include in the future would be the ability for users to add in private events on to the calendar This feature would give users the opportunity to add in their own events, such as group meetings or study schedules. This would help users plan better and help them be more prepared for upcoming events.</p>

                <span class="key_point"><p>A news section has been added on to the Home Page.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>The news section on the home page gives students easy access to important, relevant news. For instance, if the instructor is ill and class needs to be cancelled, the instructor can post it. When students go onto the website, they will be able to see this announcement quickly and know that class has been cancelled. </p>
                
                
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The footer contains sitemap, instructor email, and links to the top of the page, as well as the home page.</p></span>

                    <p>By putting the sitemap in the footer, students and instructors will always have easy access to all the links on the site. Since this can be expanded or contracted, users can shrink this feature if it is not needed. This will save users space and will keep the page from looking cluttered.</p>

                    <p>By putting the instructor email in the footer, students will be able to quickly and easily email the instructor without having to switch to another page. This also contains the instructor’s name so students know who to address the email to.</p>

                    <p>The link to the top of the page makes it easy to move back to the top once users have reached the bottom of the page. This can save users a lot of time. For example, if there is a long lecture, instead of scrolling all the way back to the top at the end of it, users can just click on the button. This will bring them back to the top of the page much faster.</p>

                    <p>The link to the home page allows users to easily access the homepage from anywhere on the website. This is especially handy if they need to access the calendar or the news section on the home page.</p>

                    
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The header contains the navigation bar, a search bar, and a login button. </p></span>

                    <p>The header contains the key components users will need access to. By placing it horizontally at the top of every page, it takes up less space and is easily accessible. </p>

                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The Navigation Bar has been divided into four main categories: home page, lessons, quizzes, and additional information/ resources about the course.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>This was designed to represent the four key sections of the website. When you hover over these, it will expand and you can choose which link your want from there. For example, if you want to get to Lecture #4, all you have to do is hover over the lecture button, and click on the lecture you want. The great thing about this feature is that you can see all your options without leaving the current page you are on. Since this was strategically divided into these categories, all the pages on the site will also have a clear home. This also means that these sections are not ambiguous, which means that users will not have to guess to find what they are looking for.</p>

                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>A Log-In feature was implemented to let users login to their personal accounts.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>From there, they can check their grades and submit assignments. When you are logged in, if you hover over your log in icon, you can access the links to submit assignments or check grades. This will also prevent unauthorized people from having access to these tools. One feature that we would add in the future is the ability to complete quizzes online.</p>

                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>The search bar on the top right hand side of the page lets users search the course site. </p></span>
                    
                    <p>For instance, if a student wants to learn more about sprites, but they do not remember which lecture it was in, they could use the search feature and it will find the relevant page(s) they are looking for. With the word “search…” in the background and the little magnifying glasses to search, users will already be familiar with this tool since it is very similar to what other popular websites use.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>Lectures are contained in the Lessons section of the Navigation bar. To access, hover over Lessons and click on the lecture you want to see.</p></span>

                    <p>This clean, simple format allows users to access the different lectures as needed, and it automatically hides itself when it is not needed. Since this is not static, it saves a lot of valuable space when not in use. Here they will also be able to find exercises, examples, and resources related to the lecture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lectures that have not occurred yet will also not be available until they have occurred. This feature will keep students from reading ahead and not focusing on the current material.</p>
                    
                    
                           
            <span class="key_point"><p>There is a timeline that shows lecture progress.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>This timeline is a bonus feature which visually shows users the progress made and how far along they are in the course. It is also an easy way to jump from one lecture to another.</p>
              
                    
                    
                    
                <span class="key_point"><p>All quizzes are contained in the Quizzes section of the Navigation bar. To access, hover over quizzes and click on the quiz you want to access.</p></span>

                    <p>This layout of the quizzes allows users to access the different quizzes as needed, and it automatically hides itself when it is not needed. On the current COMP 1950 website, doing quizzes is not an option.  As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to access quizzes since you have to go through different websites. This would make access to quizzes faster and simpler since it would all be on the same page. </p>
                        
                        
                    <p>At the bottom of quiz, there is a submit and a reset button. The submit button makes it easy to hand in quizzes, while the reset button erases all answers. For resetting, one feature we would implement would be to ask the student if they are sure they want to reset as a warning, just in case they clicked the button by mistake. </p>
                
                    <p>These online quizzes could replace the current written quizzes, since it can also accept multiple choice, true or false, or short answer questions and answers. This could also save the department resources since they would reduce the amount of paper and ink they use to print these quizzes. Another benefit of doing these quizzes online is that they can also make it easier for the instructor since they would not be forced to read handwriting.</p>

                    <p>One feature that could be implemented in the future is the ability to automatically mark quizzes once they have been submitted (such as true/false or multiple choice questions). This would give students automatic feedback, and save the instructor time for marking and handing back written quizzes. </p>

                    <p>Another feature we would add would be a timer, which automatically starts when students open the quiz. For instance, if the instructor only wants students to have 10 minutes for the quiz, they can set the time. When students click to start the quiz, the timer automatically beings. When the time runs out, if the student has not already submitted the quiz, the quiz will stop working and the only option the student will have will be to submit the quiz. This reduces academic dishonestly by preventing students from having extra time for their quiz. </p>

                    <p>This feature can also be expanded to include set quiz deadlines, where the quiz automatically becomes available and disabled at certain times. For instance, if the instructor does not want students to have access to a quiz until class time at 6:00pm, they can set it so that it automatically becomes accessible at that time. On the other hand, if the instructor wants all quizzes to be handed in by 11:59pm on a Tuesday evening, this can be set so that any quiz is no longer accessible after 11:59pm on a Tuesday evening, and any quiz in progress will have to be submitted or closed.</p>

                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
             <span class="key_point"><p>The About page contains helpful tools, resources, and additional course information.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>The About section will be helpful for users since they will be able to access additional resources that are relevant to the course. It also has links to relevant BCIT sources, such as BCIT.ca and my.bcit.ca. In addition, it has a course description.</p>

                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>Users can log in to their personal account to access grades and assignments.</p></span>
                
                    <p>On the left side of the header, there you can see that John Smith is logged on to his account. When you hover over the name, a drop down appears where you can see a link to see his grades, a link to see his homework, and a button to log out. While this feature has not been fully implemented yet, this shows what the feature would look like. This feature would add value to the COMP 1950 website since students would no longer need to access multiple sites to view their grades, and see and submit assignments easily and securely. </p>
                   
                    
                    
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>The HTML is valid, free of errors, and semantically marked up, and HTML 5 is used.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>The HTML used to develop the proposed COMP1950 page is structuraly valid and free of errors. This means that the code will run predictably, and there will not be errors when running the page. In addition, this means that it can be used by a variety of operating systems (such as Windows, Mac, Linux), and all browsers (ex. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera) Since this page is semantically marked up, this also means that it will be easier to edit the content in the future.</p>
                    
                    
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>Standard File and Folder Names have been used.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>The file names used for the HTML and CSS do not contain capital letters, spaces, or special characters. This ensures that files work the way they are supposed to and will not run in to errors. </p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>An index file has been included.</p></span>
                   
                    <p>An index.html file has been included to ensure that users cannot access files that you may not want them to access to.</p>
                    
                    

                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>External CSS has been used instead of embedded CSS.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>Having a separate file for the CSS instead of embedding it makes it easier to maintain in the future. If you ever wanted to change the design of the page, all you would have to do is change the code on the CSS page(s), rather than going on to every HTML page and modifying the embedded CSS. This is not only faster, but it also helps reduce errors since you are only changing the code of one file instead of multiple files.</p>
                    
                    
                    
            
            <span class="key_point"><p>W3 Schools was used for the CSS. </p></span>
                    
                    <p>This method for CSS was used since the site automatically creates a visually appealing CSS code for you that you can use for your site. This also makes it easier to modify the design of the website, since all you have to do is update the link and all the pages will automatically update. For instance, if you wanted to change the background color of the site to blue, this would make it easy to change.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
             <span class="key_point"><p>The pages have a stylesheet specifically for printing.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>Users may want to print out the pages from the COMP 1950 website to have a hard copy of information (such as the lectures). We designed a printer page that focuses on presenting the critical information in an easy to read format. We fully qualified any hyperlinks, and we also hid less useful content such as the navigation bar. We also ensured that new topics start on a new page, rather than having a break.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>The pages have a stylesheet specifically for small screens.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>This will allow users to still easily view the site on smaller screens, such as cell phones. This will be handy for students who study while on transit, or those who quickly want to look up their grades on their phone. We have also eliminated some features when used on small screen, such as the lecture timeline. This is beneficial since it saves valuable space.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>There is a personalized 404 error page specifically designed for the COMP 1950 website.</p></span>
                    
                    <p>The personalized Error 404 page helps redirect users to the COMP 1950 website if they try to use an invalid link. </p>
                    
                    
             <span class="key_point"><p>Javascript has been used to inplement certain features.</p></span>  
                    
                    <p>The javascript used is error free and correct. Using javascript allows certain features to be included, such as the ability to minimize and maximize the Sitemap in the footer.</p>
                    
             
                    
            <span class="key_point"><p>The page has been designed to be visually appealing.</p></span>  
                    
                    <p>All pages are designed to be visually appealing and look clutter-free. The colors were specifically chosen to have contrast. They also have simple fonts that are easy to read. This will make it easy for users to read and use the content.</p>
