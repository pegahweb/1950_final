            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a proto-site and documents for the redesign on the COMP1950 course site. This is based on techniques from throughout the course, first-hand experience as students, and a questionnaire completed by the client (the instructor). There are four parts of this project: the Introduction Page, the Proto-Site, the Sitemap, and the Rationale.</p>
            
            <p>The Introduction Page (this page) describes the project, introduces the members of the team, and explains how to navigate the proto-site. This page also states how each member contributed to the success of this project.</p>
                
            <p>The Proto-Site shows four mocked-up pages from the current COMP 1950 course website. The re-designed pages are the COMP 1950 Home Page, the Lectures page, the Quizzes page, and the Homework page. These pages represent the proposed website.</p>
                    
            <p>The Sitemap shows the proposed website information and architecture. This also shows the different links that will on the web page. </p>
                    
            <p>The Rationale page describes the proposed improvements and features implemented. In addition, this page explains why these are beneficial to the client (the instructor) and its users (the students) This page will also discuss features that are not yet implemented, but could be added in the future. </p>
        
        <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>The members of our team are Pegah Tavakoli, Jennifer Illner, and Kurtis Waterston. As a team, we designed the pages and determined how they should flow. We also determined which features to implement.</p>

            <p>Kurtis designed and coded the protosite HTML5 page, and also added in jquery plugins.  Jennifer created the content for the rationale and the introduction page. She also helped with the CSS and HTML for the protosite page. Pegah created the HTML and the CSS for meta site, and drew the site map. She also helped with the CSS and created a printer option for the Protosite page.</p>
